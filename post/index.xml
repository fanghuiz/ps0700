      <description>Table of Contents    About Informed Consent    Is informed consent always necessary when considering the ethics of social science experiments? For some experiments, obtaining informed consent could affect the results (if people are aware of what the researchers are trying to do). Exactly how much are the researchers required to inform the participants about the experiment? Does knowing you are part of an experiment affect how they respond?</description>

      <description>Table of Contents    Types of measurement Errors    How to differentiate between systematic vs random error? Do you have any examples of systematic errors in measurement? Which error (systematic vs random) is worse? Which one should we try to avoid more? About the True Score Theory $T = X + \epsilon$, how do we know how close our measured value $X$ is close to the true score $T$, if we cannot truly know $T$?</description>
