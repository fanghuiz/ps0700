It was ended after there was an increase in divorce rate.      About Informed Consent Is informed consent always necessary when considering the ethics of social science experiments? For some experiments, obtaining informed consent could affect the results (if people are aware of what the researchers are trying to do). Exactly how much are the researchers required to inform the participants about the experiment? Yes, informed consent is an essential element of research ethics.\nGenerally speaking, we have to inform the participants the purpose of our research (e.g. “This is a study about attitudes towards political candidates), though we do not have to tell them the exact hypothesis of the study.\nIt is also important that the informed consent form has to let the participants know if there is any potential benefits or harms by taking part in the study, any compensations or incentives, confidentiality or privacy of the data, their rights to decline and to withdraw, so they can make an informed decision about participating. In most cases, political science experiments only involve \u0026ldquo;minimal risks\u0026rdquo;, i.e. about the same probability and magnitude of harm we would experience in daily life.\nFor more details on the important elements to include when obtaining informed consent, see this guide from Pitt IRB, or American Psychological Association (APA) ethics code (Section 8.02). It is possible to request waivers with adequate justification (see here for an overview of the requirements).\nDoes knowing you are part of an experiment affect how they respond? Is there a way to minimize the effects of this on the outcome? Quite likely! One possibility is Hawthorne effect: simply being part of the experiment and knowing that you are being observed might change your behavior or how you respond, compare to everyday life scenario.\nA more general phenomenon (some argue subsumes the Hawthorne effect) is called demand characteristics (also see textbook p.178), referring to how participants\u0026rsquo; interpretation of the experiment\u0026rsquo;s purpose could potentially change their behaviors (e.g. behave in ways conforming to what they think the researchers want to observe, or they might behave in ways contradicting to what they perceived as the researchers\u0026rsquo; hypothesis).\nIt is worth noting however, that not all experiments are equally affected by this potential problem. We might expect that experiments looking at behaviors that are more susceptible to social desirability bias are more vulnerable to bias introduced by demand characteristics, than those looking at more benign phenomenons.\nWhile it is difficult to eliminate this effect completely in most experiments, some strategies exist. For example, researchers can devise a design that uses covert or unobtrusive treatments, so the participants are unaware that they are part of an experiment (e.g. Enos 2014, Sands 2017).\nDeception is another common, though deeply controversial strategy. For example audit experiments often rely on deception to examine socially undesirable behaviors such as discrimination (e.g. Butler and Broockman 2011), norms or rules violation (e.g. Findley, Neilson and Sharman 2014).\nOf course, the use of deception always has to be justified in the ethics review process. See this newsletter (p.13-19) for further discussion on the ethics of using deception in field experiment involving public officials as subjects.\nAbout the Montana GOTV Experiment The Montana experiment misled the people by using official seal. How did they get the project approved in the first place? Only the people involved in the process would ever know! If I were to hazard a guess (take it with many many grains of salt), it is possible that the review process did not see the mailer as being intentionally misleading. Among the commotion in the follow-up to this controversy, one detail about the mailer did not get much attention — there was in fact a disclaimer line disclosing that the mailer is part of a academic study (below the boxes indicating candidate ideology).\n  Mailer from the experiment. Squint a little to see the disclaimer. Retrieved from Internet Archive    Maybe it’s too much of a fine print, but it’s there. So you could make the argument that they are not actively trying to deceive the recipient about who is sending the mailer out, and this might be part of reason why the proposal was approved. Again, I have to emphasize that this is all speculations on my part.\nHow did the Montana experiment affected people’s decision? I don’t see a discussion on how it actually influenced the turnout or election outcome. We might never know! After the whole debacle, the study is unpublishable. Partly due to the ethical issue, partly because the data is likely unusable, given the spillover/contamination effect caused by the news coverage. After the news outlets reported about the story, those in the treatment group who have received the mailer would have known about where this mailer comes from and why they are receiving it (treatment is contaminated by extraneous factors that the researchers did not intend to provide), and those in the control group would also have known about the information in the mailer despite not receiving one (treatment spillover).\nAbout Experiments on Development Programs Are there examples of ethical and effective anti-poverty experiments? There are many examples of using randomized experiments to evaluate the impacts of anti-poverty programs. Some good places to look for them: Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) (research center at MIT), GiveWell (nonprofit focused on effective charities).\nNot a question, just an interesting observation \u0026ndash; in the US during the 1960s-70s, there was a similar program to Universal Basic Income. It was ended after there was an increase in divorce rate. Hmm, this is really interesting to know. So if the experiment shows that UBI improves some aspects of life quality (e.g. household income, children\u0026rsquo;s education), but also has other \u0026ldquo;side-effects\u0026rdquo; such as increases divorce rate, from the policy-makers\u0026rsquo; position, what should they make of this? What kind of \u0026ldquo;side-effects\u0026rdquo;, or how much, would be considered as a \u0026ldquo;reasonable\u0026rdquo; level of trade-off? Back to what we discussed in the beginning of the course, empirical evidence does not always lead to a neat solution to normative questions.\n","date":1548392400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548738000,"objectID":"42af2b4d2044a2804ed2adc2e35dc482","permalink":"https://github.com/fanghuiz/ps0700/post/2019-01-25-experiment/","publishdate":"2019-01-25T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/fanghuiz/ps0700/post/2019-01-25-experiment/","section":"post","summary":"Q\u0026A on informed consent in research, the controversial Montana GOTV experiment, and experiments on development programs","tags":["Experiments","Ethics"],"title":"Q\u0026A Week 3: Experiments and Ethics","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Example: Racial Resentment Scale Racial resentment scale is commonly used to measure symbolic racism. The scale contains four items, for each question, respondents indicate whether they agree or disagree with the statement on a five-point scale. The question wording and the respective variable number as appeared in American National Election Studies (ANES) 2016 are given below:\n V162211: \u0026lsquo;Irish, Italians, Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special favors.\u0026rsquo; V162212: \u0026lsquo;Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class.\u0026rsquo; V162213: \u0026lsquo;Over the past few years, blacks have gotten less than they deserve.\u0026rsquo; V162214: \u0026lsquo;It’s really a matter of some people not trying hard enough, if blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites.\u0026rsquo;  The assumption is that agreeing with statement 1 and 4 (or disagreeing with statement 2 and 3) are indications of resentment towards African Americans.\nValidity Test Construct validity To test for construct validity, we need to demonstrate that the indicator predicts what it is supposed to predict.\nOne aspect of construct validity is convergent validity: if theoretically we expect X and Y to be positively related, do we see a positive correlation between the indicator for X and Y?\nIn this case, theoretically we might expect that feelings of resentment towards African Americans would correlate with negative affective attitudes towards the group.\nFor illustration purposes, let\u0026rsquo;s just use a single statement from the resentment scale, statement 2 (V162212) about the effects of slavery and see if people\u0026rsquo;s answer to this questions correlates with their feeling thermometer score towards Blacks (V162312).\n. twoway (scatter V162312 V162212) (lfit V162312 V162212)  We see that higher disagreement with the statement (1 = Strongly Agree, 5 = Strongly Disagree) correlates with lower scores on the feeling thermometer (higher value means warmer feeling towards the group, lower value means colder feeling). Resentment towards African Americans (as indicated by denying the effects of slavery on their current day hardship) indeed predicts a more negative attitudes towards them (as indicated by expressing less warm feelings).\nAnother way to demonstrate construct validity is to show divergent/discriminant validity: if theoretically we do not expect X and Y to be related, do we then see a low or weak correlation between them?\nFor instance, perhaps we do not expect feelings of racial resentment to be correlated with feelings towards the Supreme Court (V162102).\n. graph twoway (scatter V162102 V162212) (lfit V162102 V162212)  We see that there is no discernible correlation between responses to statement 2 and feelings towards the Supreme Court.\nReliability Test One common way to quantify the reliability of a multiple indicator scale is to calculate the Cronbach\u0026rsquo;s alpha $\\alpha$.\nThis can be done in Stata using a simple command alpha, followed by the list of variables used in the scale.\n. alpha V162211 V162212 V162213 V162214 Test scale = mean(unstandardized items) Reversed items: V162211 V162214 Average interitem covariance: 1.090995 Number of items in the scale: 4 Scale reliability coefficient: 0.8451  In the output, we can see a \u0026ldquo;Scale reliability coefficient\u0026rdquo;, which is ~0.8 in this case. A general rule of thumb is that \u0026gt; 0.8 indicates rather high reliability, and anything below 0.7 is a sign of unreliable scale.

Levels of Measurement    Can you elaborate more on meaningful vs relative/arbitrary zero point, and how that relates to interval and ratio measures? Can a measure be both interval and ratio?      Types of measurement Errors How to differentiate between systematic vs random error? Do you have any examples of systematic errors in measurement? Systematic errors affects all units in the sample in the same direction (all measured values are consistently more positive or more negative than true value). For example, self-reported measure of turnout is likely to have positive systematic error \u0026ndash; (most) people tend to over-report, saying that they have voted even though they have not.\nRandom errors do not affect all units in the sample in a consistent way \u0026ndash; some units will be more positive than true value, some units will be more negative than true value. Let\u0026rsquo;s use the self-reported turnout as an example again. Perhaps people\u0026rsquo;s transient feelings about the current election affect whether they are likely to say they have voted or not \u0026ndash; those who happened to read a positive news story about the election are more likely to over-report having voted, and others who happened to read a negative news story are more likely to under-report.\nVery often both types of errors could be present, so we need to think carefully about the sources of potential errors. For example, crime statistics can be very noisy, with a lot of random errors introduced at various stages of collecting such data. Furthermore, statistics on certain types of crimes might additionally have systematic errors: for example, domestic abuse might be systematically biased downwards if victims under-report due to fear of retaliation.\nWhich error (systematic vs random) is worse? Which one should we try to avoid more? Both types of errors are bad news! But they affect our analysis in different ways.\nHigh random errors will add more noise/variability to our data, which will make it harder to detect the presence of a significant correlation between X and Y. In another word, noisy measures are bad because it increases the likelihood of false negative \u0026ndash; we are likely to mistakenly infer there is no relationship between X and Y, when in fact there is.\nFor systematic errors, recall that indicators with high systematic errors are invalid, i.e. they are not capturing the concept of interest accurately. In such case, an invalid indicator will never lead us to the right conclusion (think of a road sign that points to the wrong direction), even if the indicator is measured with zero random error.\n  One of them has got to be invalid..   In terms of which type of error is worse, one way I think about this is that invalid indicator is more like a fatal disease, and unreliable indicator is more like a non-fatal but chronic disease that requires lots of care. So if a study is using invalid indicators, we cannot draw any meaningful inferences about the phenomenon we are investigating (the study is \u0026ldquo;dead\u0026rdquo;), while unreliable indicators make it harder to detect a true positive (increases uncertainty, but does not spell doom).\nThe textbook also has a good discussion on the different problems associated with measurement reliability and validity in political science (p.143-145).\n    Systematic error = High Systematic error = Low     Random error = High Very very bad \u0026bull; Invalid and unreliable measure \u0026bull; Lots of noise, and signal is pointing at the wrong direction Problematic, but can live with \u0026bull; Valid, but unreliable measure \u0026bull; Lots of noise, harder to detect the signal; More likely to get false negative   Random error = Low Problematic \u0026bull; Invalid, but reliable measure \u0026bull; Measure does not capture the concept of interests; Conclusion does not bear on the actual phenomenon of interest Awesome! \u0026bull; Valid and reliable measure \u0026bull; Move along    Ideally, we should try to minimize both types of measurement errors. Degree of random error can be empirically assessed (e.g. using Cronbach\u0026rsquo;s alpha, see example here), and can be reduced (e.g. using multiple indicators). Systematic error however, is harder to detect, harder to quantify, and harder to correct for.\nAbout the True Score Theory $T = X + \\epsilon$, how do we know how close our measured value $X$ is close to the true score $T$, if we cannot truly know $T$? Unfortunately, we can never be 100% sure what the value of $T$ is. As mentioned above, while we can detect and correct for random errors, systematic errors cannot be corrected using statistical procedures. After we’ve done our best to minimize random error, it is up to the strength of our theory, clarity of conceptualization, and a small leap of faith to convince others (and ourselves), that our measures are indeed valid ones. This is also part of the reason why social science research can only establish a probabilistic relationship (confident within a certain range) and never a deterministic relationship. Embrace the uncertainty!\n  If all indicators are measured with some degrees of random errors, can too many indicators introduce more random errors? Although every single indicator would be measured with some random errors, if we combine the multiple indicators as an index, or take the average value, we should have lower random errors compared to using a single indicator.\nMeasurement Reliability and Validity Is there a good analogy to help remembering the difference between validity and reliability? In class, I\u0026rsquo;ve made the analogy comparing a valid indicator as a correct label (indicator) matching the content of a box (concept) that you wanted to buy but cannot see what is inside.\n  Houston, we have a invalid indicator problem.   I don\u0026rsquo;t really have a good one for reliability, so let\u0026rsquo;s stretch the same label-on-a-box analogy a bit further. Suppose we have a machine printing the label for the box, although the label correctly matches the box content (valid indicator), the machine sometimes misprints a letter or two, so not all labels look the same (unreliable). And if we have Machine A that produces 5% misprinted labels, and Machine B that produces 15% misprinted labels, then we can say that B is less reliable (produces less consistent outcomes).\nWhat are some examples of face validity? Whenever you see a indicator used to measure a particular concept, simply ask yourself: does the measure appear to capture the concept you care about? If yes, then the measure has high face validity; if not, then it has low face validity.\nSay I want to measure whether a country\u0026rsquo;s level of human rights protection, which of the following indicators has a higher face validity?\n Gini coefficient Number of political imprisonment  You probably have an answer in your mind. Let\u0026rsquo;s try another one: now I want to measure a country\u0026rsquo;s income inequality, which indicator has a higher face validity?\n Gini coefficient Number of political imprisonment  Again, you have an answer, and you are probably right.\nA few things I\u0026rsquo;d like to highlight from this example:\n Assessing face validity relies on domain knowledge. We need to first know what \u0026ldquo;human rights protection\u0026rdquo; means, only then we can see that more political imprisonment is an indicator for low levels of human rights protection. Assessing face validity is largely based on judgment based on domain knowledge, rather than empirical demonstration. Indicator validity is always assessed relative to the concept we are trying to capture, rather than something inherent to the indicator itself. Gini coefficient is a valid indicator for income inequality, but not human rights protection.  When do we test for construct vs face validity? Ideally both, and more if possible. Since having invalid measures are really bad news, assessing the validity of a measure in multiple ways would increase the confidence\nFace validity is rarely explicitly tested for \u0026ndash; we already implicitly test for face validity when we are making the choice of which indicators to use to measure the concept. Although having face validity is important, high face validity alone is a rather weak evidence.\nConstruct validity can be empirically assessed in two ways: convergent validity and divergent validity. See here for an example.\nGenerally, if we are using the measures that have been used in published literature, we do not have to conduct separate validity test. The assumption is that they have already been previously validated (though we should still remain critical). If we are using new measures in our study, instead of established ones used in published literature, then it is recommended to first conduct a pilot study to test the measure\u0026rsquo;s validity and reliability. Use the measures as part of the actual study only after we know it\u0026rsquo;s valid and reliable.\nAbout the article we read on using IAT/video games to measure implicit racial bias, how is the reliability of the measure determined? If the same respondent takes the test twice and gets different scores but in the same direction (e.g at first longer, then shorter time), is the measure considered reliable? For IAT, the actual computation of the score takes quite a few steps, but to simplify it a bit, it is the reaction time differential that is used as a measure of implicit racial bias (see the test procedure here). So in this case, the test can be considered as reliable if respondent has the same directional preference (e.g. consistently faster at White-Pleasant association, than Black-Pleasant association) when taking the test multiple times.\nFor other tests however, it could be the case that time difference itself, rather than directional difference is used as the measure.\nIn general, test-retest reliability is measured as degree of correlation between the different test scores, rather than absolute difference. In psychology, rule of thumb is that test-retest reliability \u0026gt; 0.7 is an acceptable level, though this is no more than a convention used by researchers. IAT has a test-retest reliability of about 0.6.\nThis Podcast has a pretty interesting discussion on the use and critique of IAT.\nLevels of Measurement Can you elaborate more on meaningful vs relative/arbitrary zero point, and how that relates to interval and ratio measures? A variable with meaningful zero point means that we can interpret the zero value as the absence of that variable. For example, income measured in dollars has a meaningful zero — we can interpret income = 0 to mean an absence of income. So if someone reported zero on this measure, we know this person has no income.\nOn the other hand, if the variable has a relative, or arbitrary zero points, we cannot interpret the zero value on that variable as the absence of that variable. Say we have a set of 5 questions to measure people’s political knowledge. Every correct answer gets you 1 point, and every wrong answer gets you 0 point, which gives us a range of possible score from 0 to 5. If Ann gets score = 0 on this scale, we cannot say that Ann has no political knowledge at all. The zero here is simply an arbitrary point to signal a very low level of political knowledge.\nSo how does this relate to interval vs ratio measures? Interval measures have relative/arbitrary zero points, and ratio measures have absolute/meaningful zero points. For the most part, the difference is only apparent (or we only need to pay attention to the difference) when we analyze and interpret the data.\nFor interval measures, since the zero point is arbitrary and lacks any meaningful interpretation, we cannot compare any differences in terms of proportion. It only make sense to compare the difference in magnitude. Going back to the political knowledge example, if Beth gets score = 2 on the political scale, and Cathy gets score = 4 on the same scale, we know that: 1) Cathy is more knowledgeable than Beth, and 2) the magnitude of difference is 2 more correct answers. However, since the zero point is arbitrary in this case, we cannot say Cathy is two times more knowledgeable than Beth. Or if we observe that Beth\u0026rsquo;s score increased from 2 to 3 after attending a civics education workshop, we cannot cay that Beth\u0026rsquo;s political knowledge increased by 50%.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s compare to a ratio scale, income, which has a meaningful zero point. If Abe reported income = 20k, and Ben reported income = 40k, we know that 1) Ben has higher income than Abe, 2) Ben\u0026rsquo;s income is 20k higher than Abe, and 3) that Ben has an income twice as much as Abe.\nCan a measure be both interval and ratio? The four levels of measurement are mutually exclusive categories. The flow chart below should help you to distinguish the four categories.\n  ","date":1547787600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548738000,"objectID":"5afe73338ff35f4df33677cf56804b78","permalink":"https://github.com/fanghuiz/ps0700/post/2019-01-18-measurement/","publishdate":"2019-01-18T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/fanghuiz/ps0700/post/2019-01-18-measurement/","section":"post","summary":"Q\u0026A on measurement errors, measurement validity and reliability, and levels of measurement","tags":["Measurement"],"title":"Q\u0026A Week 2: Measurement","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Empower your users to search your website content for keywords so that they can quickly discover relevant content.\nIf search is enabled, a search icon will automatically appear in the navigation bar and a search box will appear in the sidebar of any content using the docs/tutorial layout (as can be seen on this site).

Netlify is free and provides fast global access, automated deployment when you add or modify content, and one-click HTTPS security. Check out our guide to deploy with Netlify.\nGitHub Pages Go to Github and register for an account if you have not done so already. Github encourage using your real name as your username, and this can help your Github URL (which you will be assigned later) to have a professional appearance.\nInstall Git if it\u0026rsquo;s not already present on your system. You can check by running git --version in your Command Prompt/Terminal app.\nOnce you have created your Github account and setup Git on your computer, we will create two new repositories (often abbreviated as repos) on Github with the following names:\n academic-kickstart or any other name you like - we will save your content to this repo \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io where \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt; is your Github username - we will save the generated website to this repo  To create the \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io repository, click the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; icon in the top right corner and then choose “New Repository”.\nTo create the academic-kickstart repository, fork the Academic Kickstart repository and clone your fork with Git (download it to your computer) by replacing \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt; in the following command with your Github username:\ngit clone https://github.com/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;/academic-kickstart.git My_Website cd My_Website git submodule update --init --recursive  In your config.toml file, set baseurl = \u0026quot;https://\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io/\u0026quot;, where \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt; is your Github username. Stop Hugo if it\u0026rsquo;s running and delete the public directory if it exists (by typing rm -r public/).\nAdd your .github.io repository into a submodule in a folder named public, replacing  with your Github username:\ngit submodule add -f -b master https://github.com/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io.git public  Add everything to your local git repository and push it up to your remote repository on GitHub:\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026quot;Initial commit\u0026quot; git push -u origin master  Whilst running the above commands you may be prompted for your Github username and password.\nNext, regenerate your website\u0026rsquo;s HTML code by running Hugo and uploading the public submodule to GitHub:\nhugo cd public git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;Build website\u0026quot; git push origin master cd ..  Once Git has finished uploading your site to Github, you can open your new https://\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io website in your browser, substituting  with your Github username.\nAutomating deployment If you are feeling more adventurous, you can consider automating deployment so that when a change, such as a new blog post, is pushed to your academic-kickstart repository, your website (\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io repository) is automatically re-built. Check out the discussion forum for inspiration!\nIf you prefer easy automated deployments whenever you make a change to your site, we recommend deploying with Netlify (see above) rather than Github Pages.\nAmazon S3 By uploading the contents of your public folder to Amazon S3, your site can be served with dynamic scaling to almost unlimited traffic. This approach has the benefit of being one of the cheapest and most reliable hosting options available as you only pay for what you use.\nWeb host via FTP Use an FTP client to upload the contents of your public folder to a web host.

Now you can adjust the colors within your theme file.\nTo customize the font theme, you can copy a theme such as themes/academic/data/fonts/default.toml to data/fonts/default.toml (at the root of your site, not in themes/academic/), creating the data/fonts/ folders if they do not already exist. Now you can adjust the font size and family, choosing from the library of Google Fonts if you wish.\nIf you create your own theme, consider giving it a unique name and sharing your new color or font theme with the community.\nWebsite icon Save your main icon and mobile icon as square PNG images named icon.png (32x32 pixels) and icon-192.png (192x192 pixels), respectively. Place them in your root static/img/ folder.\nAnalytics To enable Google Analytics, add your tracking code in config.toml similarly to googleAnalytics = \u0026quot;UA-12345678-9\u0026quot;.\nComments The Disqus commenting variable (disqusShortname) in config.toml can be set to your own Disqus shortname to enable visitors to comment on your posts.\nAdd scripts (JS) To add a third party script, create a file named head_custom.html in a layouts/partials/ folder at the root of your website (not in the themes folder). Any HTML code added to this file will be included within your website\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lt;head\u0026gt;. Therefore, it\u0026rsquo;s suitable for adding custom metadata or third party scripts specified with the async attribute.\nWhereas for your own local scripts, you can link your local JS assets (relative to your root static/js) from your config.toml using custom_js = [\u0026quot;custom.js\u0026quot;].\nPermalinks Permalinks, or permanent links, are URLs to individual pages and posts on your website. They are permanent web addresses which can be used to link to your content. Using Hugo\u0026rsquo;s permalinks option these can be easily customized. For example, the blog post URL can be changed to the form yourURL/2016/05/01/my-post-slug by adding the following near the top of your config.toml (before [params] settings):\n[permalinks] post = \u0026quot;/:year/:month/:day/:slug\u0026quot;  Where :slug defaults to the filename of the post, excluding the file extension. However, slug may be overridden on a per post basis if desired, simply by setting slug = \u0026quot;my-short-post-title\u0026quot; in your post preamble.\nExample 2: let\u0026rsquo;s consider changing the URL path of posts from post/ to blog/. First, add the following parameters right above the [params] section of your config.toml:\n[permalinks] post = \u0026quot;/blog/:slug\u0026quot;  Then add aliases = [\u0026quot;/blog/\u0026quot;] to your post archive page post/_index.md so that it can be accessed from the /blog/ URL.\nCustomize style (CSS) For advanced customization of the style, you can link custom CSS assets (relative to your root static/css) from your config.toml using custom_css = [\u0026quot;custom.css\u0026quot;].\nFor example, let\u0026rsquo;s override some of Academic\u0026rsquo;s default styles. First, define custom_css = [\u0026quot;override.css\u0026quot;] in config.toml. Then we can create the file static/css/override.css, relative to your website root (i.e. not in the themes directory). Add your custom CSS to this file.\nOverride a template Hugo uses a template lookup which enables you to override any of Academic\u0026rsquo;s files without directly changing them. This can make it easier to update Academic in the future since you do not modify any of Academic\u0026rsquo;s files directly.\nTo override a template in the theme, you simply copy the file you are interested in from themes/academic/ and paste it in your site folder using a similar path. To understand how this works, you should familiarize yourself with template lookup. Finally, when you update Academic, remember to compare your version of the file against Academic\u0026rsquo;s one, in case you need to propagate any changes across.\nFor example, say we wish to add some HTML code to the navigation bar. Let\u0026rsquo;s copy the relevant file themes/academic/layout/partials/navbar.html to layout/partials/navbar.html (at the root of your site, not in themes/academic/), creating the layout/partials/ folders if they do not already exist. Now you can add the HTML code you want to your copy of the file, which will override Academic\u0026rsquo;s version.\nDate Format Academic uses the following constants to format dates and times:\n   Type Options     Year 06 2006   Month 01 1 Jan January   Day 02 2 _2 (width two, right justified)   Weekday Mon Monday   Hours 03 3 15   Minutes 04 4   Seconds 05 5   AM/PM PM pm   Timezone MST   Offset -0700 -07 -07:00 Z0700 Z07:00    To modify the format, edit date_format and time_format in config.toml using the above constants. For example, some common formats are:\n   Format Type     January 2, 2006 Date   01/02/06    Jan-02-06    Mon, 02 Jan 2006    Monday, 02 Jan 2006    15:04 Time   3:04 PM    15:04 MST     ","date":1461124800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461124800,"objectID":"4b575591f248fd10193e79c37560ce93","permalink":"https://github.com/fanghuiz/ps0700/docs/customization/","publishdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/fanghuiz/ps0700/docs/customization/","section":"docs","summary":"It is possible to carry out many customizations without editing any code in the themes/academic/ folder, making it easier to update the framework in the future.\nCustom theme To customize the color theme, you can copy a theme such as themes/academic/data/themes/default.toml to data/themes/default.toml (at the root of your site, not in themes/academic/), creating the data/themes/ folders if they do not already exist.

Widgets that you don\u0026rsquo;t need can alternatively be deleted rather than setting active to false.\nNext, let\u0026rsquo;s order the widgets according to your preference. To move a widget up or down, increase or decrease the value of the weight parameter in each widget which you activated. The widgets will be ordered in ascending order of these weights and there is no need for the weights to be consecutive numbers.\nIf your content/home/ folder is empty, populate it from the example.\n Customize it After selecting a theme and a layout, make it your own.\nCore parameters The core parameters for the website can be edited in the config.toml configuration file:\n Set baseurl to your website URL (this will be provided by your host such as Netlify)  Come back to this option later if you are unsure  Set title to your desired website title, such as your name Edit your personal/business details under [params]; these will be displayed mainly in the homepage about and contact widgets (if used). To disable a contact field, simply clear the value to \u0026quot;\u0026quot;. Place a square cropped portrait photo named portrait.jpg into the static/img/ folder, overwriting any defaults. Note that you can edit the avatar filepath to point to a different image name or clear the value to disable the avatar feature. Alternatively, set gravatar to true to use the Gravatar/Wordpress avatar associated with your email address. If you write mathematical content, set math = true, otherwise leave it as false Social/academic networking links are defined as multiples of [[params.social]]. They can be created or deleted as necessary.  Menu The [[menu.main]] entries towards the bottom of config.toml define the navigation links at the top of the website. They can be added or removed as desired, based on the layout which you chose above.\nTo link to a section of the homepage, use the form #\u0026lt;section-filename\u0026gt; where \u0026lt;section-filename\u0026gt; is the filename (without .md extension). For example, #posts references a section with filename posts.md. You can rename your section files in content/home/, just remember to use a dash (-) instead of spaces in the filename.\nTo create a dropdown sub-menu, add identifier = \u0026quot;something\u0026quot; to the parent item and parent = \u0026quot;something\u0026quot; to the child item.\n Introduce yourself Edit your biography in the about widget content/home/about.md that you copied across from the themes/academic/exampleSite/ folder.

Content can include publications, projects, talks, news/blog articles, and widget pages. After you have read this guide about creating and managing content, you may also be interested to learn about writing content with Markdown, LaTeX, and Shortcodes.\nHugo v0.49 has a bug affecting the hugo new ... commands on this page. Please update Hugo to v0.50+.\n Featured image To display a featured image in content pages, simply drag an image named featured.* (e.g. featured.jpg) into your page\u0026rsquo;s folder.\nIf your page does not have its own folder (page bundle) within its section folder, you can refactor a page named NAME.md to NAME/index.md, creating the folder NAME. There is a tool to help automate this process. Page bundles require Academic v3+ and Hugo v0.50+.\n Want to caption the image or set a focal point to influence how the image is cropped? The parameters below can be added to the bottom of your page front matter to customize the appearance of the image. The caption supports Markdown and can be used to write an image caption or credit. The focal point ensures that automatic resizes of the image keep the subject in view.\n# Featured image # To use, add an image named `featured.jpg/png` to your page's folder. [image] # Caption (optional) caption = \u0026quot;Photo by [Academic](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/)\u0026quot; # Focal point (optional) # Options: Smart, Center, TopLeft, Top, TopRight, Left, Right, BottomLeft, Bottom, BottomRight focal_point = \u0026quot;Smart\u0026quot; # Show image only in page previews? preview_only = false  Header image To display a full width header image in archive pages (e.g. YOUR_URL/post/), the header parameters below can be inserted towards the end of a page\u0026rsquo;s +++ preamble. It is assumed that the image is located in your static/img/ media library, so the full path in the example below will be static/img/header.png. The caption parameter supports Markdown and can be used to write an image caption or credit.\n[header] image = \u0026quot;header.png\u0026quot; caption = \u0026quot;Image credit: [**Academic**](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/)\u0026quot;  Math and Code To enable LaTeX math rendering for a page, you should include math = true in the page\u0026rsquo;s +++ preamble, as demonstrated in the included example site. Otherwise, to enable math on the homepage or for all pages, you must globally set math = true in config.toml.\nTo disable source code highlighting for all pages, set highlight = false in config.toml. You can then enable source code highlighting only on pages that need it by setting highlight = true in that page\u0026rsquo;s preamble. See the code-highlighting docs for more details.\nPage features The following parameters can be added to the front matter of a page to control its features:\nreading_time = false # Show estimated reading time? share = false # Show social sharing links? profile = false # Show author profile? comments = false # Show comments?  Create a publication Automatically The leading reference management tools enable you to export your publications to the open BibTeX format. If you are new to research we recommend managing references with Zotero, a popular open source tool.\nIn your reference management tool, create a list of your own publications and export it as a *.bib BibTeX file.\nPython 3 is a prerequisite, so please install Python 3 if it\u0026rsquo;s not already installed. Also, you should backup your website before continuing, or ensure that it is checked into Git so that you can review the changes that will be proposed by Academic\u0026rsquo;s admin tool later on.\nOpen your Terminal or Command Prompt app and install Academic\u0026rsquo;s admin tool:\npip3 install -U academic  Use the cd command to navigate to your website folder in the terminal.\nThen import your publications with:\nacademic import --bibtex \u0026lt;path_to_your/publications.bib\u0026gt;  The tool is in beta status and intended purely to help assist you, so the generated output in the publications folder should be reviewed prior to publishing your site. You can also consider enhancing the output by taking a look at the front matter parameters in the files alongside the details in the Manually section below.\nTo contribute to the tool or submit feature requests and bug report, please check out the Academic admin tool on GitHub.\nManually Alternatively, publications can be manually created using the command:\nhugo new --kind publication publication/\u0026lt;my-publication\u0026gt;  where \u0026lt;my-publication\u0026gt; is the name of your publication, using hyphens (-) instead of spaces.\nThen edit the parameters in content/publication/\u0026lt;my-publication\u0026gt;/index.md to include the details of your publication. The main parameters include:\n title: the title of your publication date: the date that your publication was first published (must be in a valid TOML date format) publication_types: use the legend to specify the type of your publication, e.g. conference proceedings publication: where your title was published - Markdown formatting is enabled here for italic etc. abstract: the summary of your publication  Further details on your publication can be written in the body of the document (after the +++ metadata section ends) using Markdown for formatting. This text will be displayed on the publication\u0026rsquo;s page.\nTo enable visitors to read your work, either paste a link to your PDF in url_pdf or add a PDF file with the same name as your publication\u0026rsquo;s own folder to your publication\u0026rsquo;s folder and a PDF link will be automatically generated. For example, if your publication is located at publication/photons/index.md, place a PDF at publication/photons/photons.pdf.\nTo enable visitors to easily cite your work, export a BibTeX citation file named cite.bib from your reference management tool to your publication\u0026rsquo;s own folder and a citation link will be automatically generated.\nLinking other resources\nThe url_ links can either point to local or web content. Associated local publication content, may be copied to the publication\u0026rsquo;s folder and referenced like url_code = \u0026quot;code.zip\u0026quot;.\nYou can also associate custom link buttons with the publication by adding the following block within the front matter:\nurl_custom = [{name = \u0026quot;Custom Link 1\u0026quot;, url = \u0026quot;http://example.org\u0026quot;}, {name = \u0026quot;Custom Link 2\u0026quot;, url = \u0026quot;http://example.org\u0026quot;}]  Any double quotes (\u0026quot;) or backslashes (e.g. LaTeX \\times) occurring within the value of any frontmatter parameter (such as the abstract) should be escaped with a backslash (\\). For example, the symbol \u0026quot; and LaTeX text \\times become \\\u0026quot; and \\\\times, respectively. Refer to the TOML documentation for more info.\n Create a blog post To create a blog/news article:\nhugo new --kind post post/my-article-name  Then edit the newly created file content/post/my-article-name.md with your full title and content.\nHugo will automatically generate summaries of posts that appear on the homepage. If you are dissatisfied with an automated summary, you can either limit the summary length by appropriately placing \u0026#60;\u0026#33;\u0026#45;\u0026#45;more\u0026#45;\u0026#45;\u0026#62; in the article body, or completely override the automated summary by adding a summary parameter to the +++ preamble such that:\nsummary = \u0026quot;Summary of my post.\u0026quot;  To disable commenting for a specific post, you can add disable_comments = true to the post +++ preamble. Or to disable commenting for all posts, you can either set disqusShortname = \u0026quot;\u0026quot; or disable_comments = true in config.toml.\nCreate a project To create a project:\nhugo new --kind project project/my-project-name  Then edit the newly created file content/project/my-project-name.md. Either you can link the project to an external project website by setting the external_link = \u0026quot;http://external-project.com\u0026quot; variable at the top of the file, or you can add content (below the final +++) in order to render a project page on your website.\nCreate a talk To create a talk:\nhugo new --kind talk talk/my-talk-name  Then edit the newly created file content/talk/my-talk-name.md with your full talk title and details. Note that many of the talk parameters are similar to the publication parameters.\nCreate slides Slides can be created very efficiently using Markdown, presented to your audience, and shared on your site. Speaker notes included!\nSee the slides demo - although note that this demo is hosted by Hugo team and they have modified their demo to reduce functionality. Build the example site (themes/academic/exampleSite/) locally to see the full demo including speaker notes.\nRefer to the example slide deck at themes/academic/exampleSite/content/slides/example-slides.md to learn how to get started.\nLink slides to a talk or publication by editing the url_slides option in the talk/publication page to point to your slides. For example, url_slides = \u0026quot;slides/example-slides\u0026quot; points to the slide deck in this example. See the full example front matter which includes url_slides here.\nCreate a course or documentation The docs layout is designed for knowledge sharing. Use cases include online courses, tutorials, software documentation, and knowledge bases.\nThis website is using the docs layout for the purpose of documenting Academic. Also, there is a online course demo.\nRefer to the example course at themes/academic/exampleSite/content/tutorial/ to learn how to get started.\nIf you are a data analyst/scientist using the R language (e.g. RStudio and RMarkdown), we recommend taking a look at the dedicated R boilerplate project on GitHub.\nCreate a widget page So you would like to create a page which utilizes Academic\u0026rsquo;s widget system, similar to the homepage?\nCreate a new folder in your content folder, naming it with your new page name. In this example, we will create a tutorials page by creating a content/tutorials/ folder.\nWithin your new content/tutorials/ folder, create a file named _index.md containing the following parameters:\n+++ title = \u0026quot;Tutorials\u0026quot; # Add a page title. date = 2017-01-01T00:00:00 # Add today's date. widgets = true # Page type is a Widget Page. summary = \u0026quot;\u0026quot; # Add a page description. +++  Install widgets into your content/tutorials/ folder. To achieve this, widgets can be copied from your content/home/ folder or downloaded from Github.\nCreate other pages (e.g. CV) For other types of content, it is possible to create your own custom pages. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s create a cv.md page for your Curriculum Vitae in your content folder. Copy across the frontmatter from the top of one of your post files, adapting it as necessary, and editing your Markdown content below. You can then link to your new page by adding the code [My CV]{{\u0026lt; ref \u0026quot;cv.md\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} to any of your existing content.\nAlternatively, for the above example, we could use a PDF of your Curriculum Vitae. For this purpose, create a folder called files within your static folder and move a PDF file named cv.pdf to that location, so we have a static/files/cv.pdf file path. The PDF can then be linked to from any content by using the code: {{% staticref \u0026quot;files/cv.pdf\u0026quot; %}}Download my CV{{% /staticref %}}.\nManage archive pages The archive (or node index) pages (e.g. /post/) are the special pages which list all of your content. They can exist for blog posts, publications, and talks. The homepage widgets will automatically link to the archive pages when you have more items of content than can be displayed in the widget. Therefore, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have much content, you may not see the automatic links yet - but you can also manually link to them using a normal Markdown formatted link in your content.\nYou can edit the title and add your own content, such as an introduction, by copying the following content _index.md files from the example site to the same structure within your content/ folder:\n/themes/academic/exampleSite/content/post/_index.md /themes/academic/exampleSite/content/publication/_index.md /themes/academic/exampleSite/content/talk/_index.md  Then edit the title parameter in each _index.md as desired and add any content after the +++ preamble/frontmatter ends. You will notice that the _index.md files differ slightly, with some having special options available for the associated content type. For example, publication/_index.md contains an option for setting the citation style of the listings which appear on the publication archive page.\nRemoving content Generally, to remove content, simply delete the relevant page file/folder from your content/post, content/publication, content/project, or content/talk folder.\nView your updated site After you have made changes to your site, you can view it by running the hugo server command and then opening localhost:1313 in your web browser.\nDeploy your site Finally, you can deploy your site.\n","date":1460952000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1460952000,"objectID":"fa822beb1fcbbceaa3d8a709edf9beae","permalink":"https://github.com/fanghuiz/ps0700/docs/managing-content/","publishdate":"2016-04-18T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/fanghuiz/ps0700/docs/managing-content/","section":"docs","summary":"This is a brief guide to managing content with the Academic framework.

Then paste the URL in the form:\n{{\u0026lt; gdocs src=\u0026quot;https://docs.google.com/...\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Speaker Deck:\n{{\u0026lt; speakerdeck 4e8126e72d853c0060001f97 \u0026gt;}}  Code highlighting Pass the language of the code, such as python, as a parameter after three backticks:\n```python # Example of code highlighting input_string_var = input(\u0026quot;Enter some data: \u0026quot;) print(\u0026quot;You entered: {}\u0026quot;.format(input_string_var)) ```  Result:\n# Example of code highlighting input_string_var = input(\u0026quot;Enter some data: \u0026quot;) print(\u0026quot;You entered: {}\u0026quot;.format(input_string_var))  Highlighting options The Academic theme uses highlight.js for source code highlighting, and highlighting is enabled by default for all pages. However, several configuration options are supported that allow finer-grained control over highlight.js.\nThe following table lists the supported options for configuring highlight.js, along with their expected type and a short description. A \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; in the config.toml column means the value can be set globally in config.toml, and a \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; in the preamble column means that the value can be set locally in a particular page\u0026rsquo;s preamble.\n   option type description config.toml preamble     highlight boolean enable/disable highlighting yes yes   highlight_languages slice choose additional languages yes yes   highlight_style string choose a highlighting style yes no    Option highlight The highlight option allows enabling or disabling the inclusion of highlight.js, either globally or for a particular page. If the option is unset, it has the same effect as if you had specified highlight = true. That is, the highlight.js javascript and css files will be included in every page. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to only include highlight.js files on pages that actually require source code highlighting, you can set highlight = false in config.toml, and then override it by setting highlight = true in the preamble of any pages that require source code highlighting. Conversely, you could enable highlighting globally, and disable it locally for pages that do not require it. Here is a table that shows whether highlighting will be enabled for a page, based on the values of highlight set in config.toml and/or the page\u0026rsquo;s preamble.\n   config.toml page preamble highlighting enabled for page?     unset or true unset or true yes   unset or true false no   false unset or false no   false true yes    Option highlight_languages The highlight_languages option allows you to specify additional languages that are supported by highlight.js, but are not considered \u0026ldquo;common\u0026rdquo; and therefore are not supported by default. For example, if you want source code highlighting for Go and clojure in all pages, set highlight_languages = [\u0026quot;go\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;clojure\u0026quot;] in config.toml. If, on the other hand, you want to enable a language only for a specific page, you can set highlight_languages in that page\u0026rsquo;s preamble.\nThe highlight_languages options specified in config.toml and in a page\u0026rsquo;s preamble are additive. That is, if config.toml contains, highlight_languages = [\u0026quot;go\u0026quot;] and the page\u0026rsquo;s preamble contains highlight_languages = [\u0026quot;ocaml\u0026quot;], then javascript files for both go and ocaml will be included for that page.\nIf the highlight_languages option is set, then the corresponding javascript files will be served from the cdnjs server. To see a list of available languages, visit the cdnjs page and search for links with the word \u0026ldquo;languages\u0026rdquo;.\nThe highlight_languages option provides an easy and convenient way to include support for additional languages to be severed from a CDN. If serving unmodified files from cdnjs doesn\u0026rsquo;t meet your needs, you can include javascript files for additional language support via one of the methods described in the customization guide.\nOption highlight_style The highlight_style option allows you to select an alternate css style for highlighted code. For example, if you wanted to use the solarized-dark style, you could set highlight_style = \u0026quot;solarized-dark\u0026quot; in config.toml.\nIf the highlight_style option is unset, the default is to use the file /css/highlight.min.css, either the one provided by the Academic theme, or else the one in your local static directory. The /css/highlight.min.css file provided by Academic is equivalent to the github style from highlight.js.\nIf the highlight_style option is set, then /css/highlight.min.css is ignored, and the corresponding css file will be served from the cdnjs server. To see a list of available styles, visit the cdnjs page and search for links with the word \u0026ldquo;styles\u0026rdquo;.\nSee the highlight.js demo page for examples of available styles.\nNot all styles listed on the highlight.js demo page are available from the cdnjs server. If you want to use a style that is not served by cdnjs, just leave highlight_style unset, and place the corresponding css file in /static/css/highlight.min.css.\n If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to change the default style that ships with Academic but you do want the style file served from the cdnjs server, set highlight_style = \u0026quot;github\u0026quot; in config.toml.\n The highlight_style option is only recognized when set in config.toml. Setting highlight_style in your page\u0026rsquo;s preamble has no effect.\nTwitter tweet To include a single tweet, pass the tweet’s ID from the tweet\u0026rsquo;s URL as parameter to the shortcode:\n{{\u0026lt; tweet 666616452582129664 \u0026gt;}}  GitHub gist {{\u0026lt; gist USERNAME GIST-ID \u0026gt;}}  $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math $$\\left [ – \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + V \\right ] \\Psi = i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\Psi$$  $$\\left [ – \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + V \\right ] \\Psi = i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\Psi$$\nAlternatively, inline math can be written by wrapping the formula with only a single $:\nThis is inline: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol\\beta + \\boldsymbol\\varepsilon$  This is inline: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol\\beta + \\boldsymbol\\varepsilon$\nNote that Markdown special characters need to be escaped with a backslash so they are treated as math rather than Markdown. For example, * and _ become \\* and \\_ respectively.\nMultiline equations The standard LaTeX line break consisting of 2 backslashes needs to be replaced with 6 backslashes:\n$$f(k;p\\_0^\\*) = \\begin{cases} p\\_0^\\* \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1-p\\_0^\\* \u0026amp; \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  $$f(k;p_0^*) = \\begin{cases} p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\n1-p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nPublication abstracts As Hugo and Academic attempt to parse TOML, Markdown, and LaTeX content in the abstract, the following guidelines should be followed just for the publication abstract and abstract_short fields:\n escape each LaTeX backslash (\\) with an extra backslash, yielding \\\\ escape each LaTeX underscore (_) with two backslashes, yielding \\\\_  Hence, abstract = \u0026quot;${O(d_{\\max})}$\u0026quot; becomes abstract = \u0026quot;${O(d\\\\_{\\\\max})}$\u0026quot;.\nTable Code:\n| Command | Description | | ------------------| ------------------------------ | | `hugo` | Build your website. | | `hugo serve -w` | View your website. |  Result:\n   Command Description     hugo Build your website.   hugo serve -w View your website.    Alerts Alerts are a useful feature that add side content such as tips, notes, or warnings to your articles. They are especially handy when writing educational tutorial-style articles. Use the corresponding shortcodes to enable alerts inside your content:\n{{% alert note %}} Here's a tip or note... {{% /alert %}}  This will display the following note block:\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a tip or note\u0026hellip;\n {{% alert warning %}} Here's some important information... {{% /alert %}}  This will display the following warning block:\nHere\u0026rsquo;s some important information\u0026hellip;\n Table of Contents A table of contents may be particularly useful for long posts or tutorial/documentation type content.

Therefore, you must follow the full installation guide found on the Demo/Documentation website or in the Github Readme. If you still have problems, first try running Hugo on the Academic Example Site found in the themes/academic/exampleSite folder and then compare the configuration parameters in the Example Site\u0026rsquo;s config.toml and content files with the files in your existing site.\nHosting your site with Netlify or Cloudflare and experience strange behavior such as filters not working?\nDisable post-processing steps such as minification in your Netlify/Cloudflare admin panel.\nPublications and other content are not sorted by newest first\nHugo/TOML require that the value for the date field should be in TOML format, as per frontmatter of the content/publication/ files in the example site. If you want to use a partial date, such as year, you should still complete a full date to make a valid TOML date format.\nIssue parsing LaTeX in publication abstract\nLet\u0026rsquo;s consider the following LaTeX which fails to parse correctly:\nabstract = \u0026quot;${O(d_{\\max})}$\u0026quot;  This is a side effect of Academic and Hugo attempting to parse TOML, Markdown and LaTeX content in the abstract. The solution is to:\n escape each LaTeX backslash (\\) with an extra backslash, yielding \\\\ escape each LaTeX underscore (_) with two backslashes, yielding \\\\_.  Hence, editing the above example, we get:\nabstract = \u0026quot;${O(d\\\\_{\\\\max})}$\u0026quot;  Cannot achieve line break in multiline equation (LaTeX/Mathjax)\n\\\\ usually achieves a line break in a multiline LaTeX/Mathjax equation, but due to Hugo\u0026rsquo;s Markdown parser it doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nSolution: use 6 backslashes for a line break, for example:\n$$\\begin{eqnarray} y \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; 1+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; 2 \\end{eqnarray}$$  ","date":1460260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1511326800,"objectID":"956da29f025cba37fca9fe6b80ab5d48","permalink":"https://github.com/fanghuiz/ps0700/docs/faq/","publishdate":"2016-04-10T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/fanghuiz/ps0700/docs/faq/","section":"docs","summary":"Troubleshoot common issues.","tags":null,"title":"Troubleshooting","type":"docs"},{"authors":["GA Cushen"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1441080000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441080000,"objectID":"d77fa4a74076ffcd7ca6c21cfc27a4b2","permalink":"https://github.com/fanghuiz/ps0700/publication/person-re-id/","publishdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/fanghuiz/ps0700/publication/person-re-id/","section":"publication","summary":"Person re-identification is a critical security task for recognizing a person across spatially disjoint sensors. Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging.

Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like\n▾ \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become\n▾ \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you\u0026rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.\nFix content Depending on the amount of customization that was done for each post in Jekyll, this step will require more or less effort. There are no hard and fast rules here except that hugo server --watch and the Hugo Academic example site are your friends. Test your changes and fix errors as needed.\nPublish The default is for Jekyll to publish the website to a _site directory, whereas Hugo publishes to a public directory.\nA practical example Alexandre Normand migrated his website from Jekyll to Hugo in less than a day.
